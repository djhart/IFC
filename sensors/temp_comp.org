* Temperature Compensation
** TODO Use curl to get station data
*** curl "url"
*** {} for multiples in list
*** either use one call to pull many files or make many calls, preferably one call
** TODO Use synoptic API to pull temp data nearest to station (start with Walnut Creek but make scalable)
*** Use this https://developers.synopticdata.com/mesonet/v2/stations/timeseries/
*** Write it so it just pulls from station metadata
*** should be easy, may need to convert data to hash/array
** TODO Write correction algorithm
*** There was one from another sensor company that was just linear. Find this and try it before writing your own.
** TODO Use org-babel (?) to apply correction to water levels with temps from synoptic.
*** Make sure that this works before going further. Get the USGS/IFC graph that Witek had for comparison
** TODO Apply it to all the sensors
*** Try to do the whole thing automated just from the master list. Will need to make it robust bc some on list will throw error.
